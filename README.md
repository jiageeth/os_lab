# CSL204 Operating Systems Lab programs
Welcome to the CSL204 Operating Systems Lab Codes repository! This repository contains various Operating Systems lab programs implemented in C. 

## üìù Preamble
The course aims to offer  students a hands-on experience on Operating System 
concepts using a constructivist approach and problem-oriented learning. Operating systems are 
the fundamental part of every computing device to run any type of software. 

## üìö Contents

1. **Shell Programming**
   - manual calculator
   - fibonocci series
   - search a word in a file
   - print the palindrome numbers between  two numbers that will given as command line arguments.

2. **System Calls in Linux**
   - create a child process and the parent waits for the child process to exit.
   - a parent which create a child process and child  process produce another process for the 
     addition of two numbers.
   - program which reads a file contained and display the status of each file contained in it.

3. **File I/O System Calls**
   - write program to create file,write some data and read from it.
       
4. **Inter-Process Communication**
   - Shared Memory implementation
