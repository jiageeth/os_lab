# CSL204 Operating Systems Lab programs
Welcome to the CSL204 Operating Systems Lab Codes repository! This repository contains various Operating Systems lab programs implemented in C. 

## üìù Preamble
The course aims to offer  students a hands-on experience on Operating System 
concepts using a constructivist approach and problem-oriented learning. Operating systems are 
the fundamental part of every computing device to run any type of software. 

## üìö Contents
